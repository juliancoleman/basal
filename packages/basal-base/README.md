# Base

Basal Base contains core foundation and component classes that serve as the base classes for all of Basal Web's foundation classes and components (respectively).

Most of the time, you shouldn't need to depend on basal-base directly. It is useful however if you'd like to write custom components that follow Basal Web's pattern and elegantly integrate with the Basal Web ecosystem.
